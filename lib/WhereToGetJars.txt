The code in this modification links against the minecraft jars, lwjgl.jar and minecraft.jar.
These can be obtained from your working copy of minecraft, in the bin subfolder.

This library also requires the dzHooksManager library, which can be downloaded from
http://wrongplace.be/files/minecraft_patches/final/1.2.4/%21REQUIRED/dzHooksManager/dzHooksManager.0.1_1.2.4.zip

Copies of these two jar files and the zip file should be placed in the lib subdirectory of this project.
